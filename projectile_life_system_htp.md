Projectile Life System (HTP)

A micro-framework that fixes one of the biggest flaws in RPG/ARPG/MMO combat.

---

Core Idea

Every skill/projectile has its own HP (Life).  
It decays over distance, can be damaged, can clash with other skills, and can be drained.

This turns projectiles from “mindless objects” into living entities with real combat interactions.

---

Core Mechanics

1. Skill HP (Life)

Each skill has a stat:

SkillLife = BaseLife × (UserMagicPowerScaling)

This HP represents the skill’s energy durability.

---

2. Distance Decay

The skill gradually loses HP as it travels:

HP_loss = Distance × DecayRate

→ Skills weaken over range and cannot travel infinitely.

---

3. Projectile Clash

When two skills collide:

- Skill A Life > Skill B Life → A pierces through (remaining Life = LifeA – LifeB)  
- Skill A Life < Skill B Life → A is destroyed  
- Life equal → both explode on the spot

---

4. Projectile Damage Taken

Any damage source can reduce a skill’s Life:

- Bullets/projectiles  
- Other spells  
- Melee weapons hitting the skill  
- Traps  
- Auras  
- Terrain effects

→ Combat gains many layers of depth.

---

5. Skill Drain (Energy Leech)

Certain player skills can leech Life from enemy skills to:

- Increase damage  
- Extend duration  
- Increase size  
- Change properties (if enough Life is drained)

---

6. Death Behavior

When SkillLife reaches 0 → the skill “dies” and can:

- Explode  
- Dissipate  
- Break down into raw energy  
- Trigger a secondary effect (if designed)

---

Examples

Fireball

BaseLife: 100  
DecayRate: 2 HP/m  

Travels 30m → loses 60 HP → arrives with 40 HP remaining.

If it collides with an Ice Lance (Life = 50):  

Ice Lance (50) > Fireball (40) → Fireball is destroyed, Ice Lance continues with 10 Life left.

---

Lightning Beam (drain type)

The beam drains 5 HP/s from nearby enemy projectiles.  
If it passes through 3 enemy projectiles:  

3 × 5 = 15 HP/s drained  
→ Beam grows thicker and deals increased damage.

---

Notes

A micro-framework that opens up an entirely new combat system.

Perfect for RPG / ARPG / MMO / MOBA / fantasy shooters.

Easy to prototype: just add a Life value to your projectile class.

Creates meaningful counterplay: “fight skill with skill”.

100% compatible with HTP’s Relative Defense and Armor Layer systems.

Serves as a foundation for a full “Spell Ecosystem” — where skills behave like living energy entities.
